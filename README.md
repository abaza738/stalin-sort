# Stalin Sort!
Order must be maintained. Defiants shall be eliminated.

## General
This humble package is inspired by a user named "Klappspaten" on YouTube who, one day, commented on [Tom Scott's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGuJga2Gl_k) as follows:  
> I recently read a paper on a new linear sorting algorithm: It's called Stalin-Sort.
It achieves this by simply eliminating any element that isn't in order.  

As the saying goes: "The Internet delivers".

## More Details
The `sort` function takes an array of values, presuming the values are sortable, and a flag defining if the sort should be ascending or descending. It then removes any value that is not in the specified order.
